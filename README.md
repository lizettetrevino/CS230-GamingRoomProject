# CS230-GamingRoomProject  
Software design document and journal reflections for The Gaming Room project.  

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was the client for this project. They wanted to expand their game *Draw It or Lose It* into a web-based application. The main requirements were that the game could support multiple players and teams, run smoothly across platforms, and be scalable and secure.  

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  
One of my biggest strengths in this project was taking the design and turning it into working code. When things didn’t run correctly, I was able to troubleshoot and fix the issues until the program worked as intended. I feel my debugging skills and persistence really helped me connect the design stage to the coding stage.  

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped me organize my ideas before coding. Having the structure and requirements laid out gave me a clearer plan to follow, which made the coding process smoother and less confusing.  

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could go back and improve something, I would spend more time on platform compatibility. I touched on it, but I think adding more details about cloud deployment or containerization would make the design stronger for long-term use.  

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on what the users would want from the game, like easy use, smooth performance, and scalability. It’s important to design with the user in mind, because even if the code is strong, the project won’t succeed if it doesn’t meet user expectations.  

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was to break the project into smaller steps: gathering requirements, creating the architecture, and then coding based on the design. In the future, I’d continue using structured methods like UML diagrams and iterative updates, since they keep the project organized and make sure the design stays aligned with the client’s needs.
